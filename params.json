{"name":"Musescore TempoChanges","tagline":"MuseScore (https://musescore.org) plugin applying linear Tempo changes such as accelerando and ritardando.","body":"# MuseScore TempoChanges\r\nThis plugin uses the hidden tempo texts technique to simulate linear tempo changes such as accelerando and ritradando in [MuseScore](https://musescore.org). The technique itself is taken straight out of [the online handbook](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/tempo-0#ritardando-accelerando).\r\n\r\n### How does it work?\r\n1. Select the range of notes over which the tempo change has to take place\r\n2. Open up the plugin from `Plugins > TempoChanges`\r\n  * **Staff Text:** Optional staff text to be created at the start of the tempo change. Leave blank if undesired.\r\n  * **Start BPM:** Tempo of the first note in the selection (base beat = 1/4th note)\r\n  * **End BPM:** Tempo of the first note *after* the selection (base beat = 1/4th note)\r\n3. Hit `Apply`. The plugin will now create invisible tempo texts on each segment within the selection and a final visible one on the first note after the selection with the resulting end tempo.\r\n\r\n### Download and Install\r\nhttps://github.com/jeetee/MuseScore_TempoChanges/archive/1.0.zip\r\n\r\nFor installation see [Plugins](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/plugins-0).\r\n\r\nTested with MuseScore 2.0.2, should work on 2.0+\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
